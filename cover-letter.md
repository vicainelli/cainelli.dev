Hello, `${COMPANY}` ðŸ™‚,

My name is Vinicius, Iâ€™m a Frontend Developer based out of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and I create accessible, fast, fun, and innovative websites. I try to leave every bit of code I touch more readable, modular, performant and accessible than I found it. 

Iâ€™ve worked with different companies and industries. At Bcash/PayU, a fintech that provides financial solutions for local and cross border merchants in emerging markets,  I'd the opportunity to learn a lot working beside a UX Designer and a Product Manager, and I had a big challenge: transform the checkout process into responsive. This project took 3 months and after that, we can saw an increase in sales conversion by 30%.

Beyond coding chops, Iâ€™m also passionate about UI design. I really value the ability to not only perform web development work but also help others improve their craft because Iâ€™ve gained so much from others sharing their skills and knowledge.

On a team, I tend to help bring out a clearer sense of purpose and encourage clearer communication, resulting in better team results and a higher sense of satisfaction for all involved.

Letâ€™s talk about how I could put my eye for detail, the practice of web standards and communication skills to work for `${COMPANY}` and friends. 

Thanks for your attention.

Vinicius Cainelli
