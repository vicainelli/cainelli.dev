I've recently started using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) alongside [z.ai's GLM-4.7 model](https://z.ai/models/GLM-4.7) and wanted to share my experience.

If you never heard about GLM-4.7, it's a powerful language model developed by Zhipu AI, known for its versatility in handling various NLP tasks.

I'm currently testing the Lite plan, which costs $3/month and offers and 3× usage of the Claude Pro plan

They have a [quick start guide](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/claude) that walks you through the setup process, so I won't repeat all the steps here.
