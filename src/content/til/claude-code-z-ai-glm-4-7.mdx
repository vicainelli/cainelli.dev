I'm using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with [z.ai's GLM 4.7](https://z.ai/models/GLM-4.7). GLM 4.7 is an open-source model from Zhipu AI (MIT license) with +3k parameters and a massive 200K context window.

The $3/month Lite plan gives me 3x Claude Pro usage. GLM 4.7 excels at tool calling (crucial for Claude Code's agent workflows) has improved multi-step reasoning.

If you use Claude Code and want to cut API costs while keeping performance, GLM 4.7 is worth trying.
