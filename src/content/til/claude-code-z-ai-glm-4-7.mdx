I've recently started using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) alongside [z.ai's GLM 4.7 model](https://z.ai/models/GLM-4.7) and wanted to share my experience.

## What is GLM 4.7?

If you haven't heard about GLM 4.7, it's a powerful language model developed by Zhipu AI, a Beijing based AI company. It was released on December 22, 2025, as an open source model with an MIT license, which means you can actually customize it in ways that aren't possible with proprietary models.

What makes it interesting is the architecture. It uses a Mixture of Experts approach with 358B parameters, but the key feature for me is the massive context window, 200K tokens. That's huge for working with large codebases or extensive documentation.

## The setup

I'm currently testing the Lite plan, which costs $3 per month and offers three times the usage of the Claude Pro plan. They have a [quick start guide](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/tool/claude) that walks you through the setup process, so getting started is pretty straightforward.

## What stands out

The main reason I'm using GLM 4.7 with Claude Code is the agentic coding capabilities. It's specifically designed for this use case, with better code generation quality and improved frontend design capabilities.

Some features that have been useful:

**Better at tool calling.** GLM 4.7 is rated as one of the best models for tool calling, which matters when you're working with Claude Code's agent workflows.

**Improved reasoning.** It has a structured thinking mechanism that helps with multi step reasoning. In practice, this means more stable reasoning chains and better performance on complex coding tasks.

**Strong coding performance.** It achieves 73.8% on SWE bench, with real world testing showing 18 to 20% more complex coding tasks solved compared to the previous version.

## The economics

What's interesting is that it achieves 95% plus of Claude's SWE bench performance at less than 15% of the cost. For someone who does a lot of coding with AI assistance, that economics are hard to ignore.

It's also open source, which means you can run it on your own infrastructure if you need to, something that's not possible with closed models.

## Should you try it?

If you're using Claude Code and want to reduce your API costs while maintaining most of the performance, GLM 4.7 is worth checking out. The combination of Claude Code's interface with GLM 4.7's capabilities works surprisingly well.

The Lite plan at $3 per month is a low risk way to try it out, and if you need more, they have higher tier plans available.
