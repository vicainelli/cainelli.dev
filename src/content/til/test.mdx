Astro collections are a powerful feature that allows you to group and manage related content in your Astro projects. They help you organize your content efficiently and make it easier to query and display.

```json
{
  "slug": "my-first-collection-item"
}
```

example in ts

```ts
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
const blogPosts = await getCollection("blog");
```
