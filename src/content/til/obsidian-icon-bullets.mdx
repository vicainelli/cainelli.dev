I just discovered that Obsidian has icon bullets, and honestly, I can't believe I missed this!

I've been using Obsidian for all my notes, templates, and meeting logs (both work and personal), but I never knew you could swap regular checkboxes for these neat little icons.

They make lists look cleaner, softer, and so much more fun to use.
Such a small detail, but it makes my note-taking feel way more organized and alive.

Here's a quick screenshot of how it looks 👇
