## An ever‑assembling voyage

Working at IKEA has been an incredible journey filled with challenges, growth, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. As a Senior Software Engineer, I've had the privilege to contribute to projects that impact millions of customers worldwide.

## Innovating for a better everyday life

At IKEA, I architected the frontend platform for the global IKEA Family rewards program. This wasn't just about writing code—it was about creating a foundation that would serve customers across 10+ countries. I drove the standardized rollout, establishing security compliance, localization patterns, and a multi-team coordination framework that brought diverse teams together.

## Building the foundation

One of my most impactful contributions was re-engineering our CI/CD infrastructure. We migrated from a patchwork of tools to GitHub Actions on Google Cloud Platform with Terraform, eliminating pipeline conflicts and reducing build/test cycles by 60%. The deployment standards I established became the blueprint adopted across the entire engineering organization.

## Quality as a mindset

I believe that great software starts with great testing. I established a comprehensive testing strategy using Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright, then integrated coverage gates directly into our CI pipeline. This shift reduced production incidents and accelerated code review cycles—proving that investing in quality pays dividends in velocity.

## Security and scale

Serving as the security focal point for my team, I remediated vulnerabilities and established dependency management policies that aligned with enterprise security standards. When you're dealing with customer data across multiple markets, security isn't an afterthought—it's the foundation of everything we build.

## Empowering teams

The most rewarding part of my role has been scaling team effectiveness through mentorship and process improvements. By advocating for testing, establishing documentation standards, and coordinating cross-team dependencies, we reduced PR cycle time significantly. I also provisioned reproducible infrastructure with Terraform, improving environment parity and enabling self-service deployments for product teams.

## Looking forward

Every day at IKEA brings new challenges and opportunities to create a better everyday life for our customers and coworkers. The journey continues, and I'm excited for what's next.
