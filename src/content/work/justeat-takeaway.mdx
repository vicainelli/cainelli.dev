When I joined Just Eat Takeaway in 2020, different squads were building the same UI components in slightly different ways. Not great for consistency or efficiency.

I built a design system in Vue that eventually served about 10 product squads. The real value wasn't the components themselves, but creating a shared language between designers and developers. I defined component API standards, a versioning strategy, and migration playbooks so teams could adopt it without pain.

The tricky part was governance. How do you let squads move fast while keeping things consistent? I wrote contribution guidelines that balanced structure with autonomy. Testing was critical. I integrated Jest into the CI pipeline so we wouldn't break APIs when making changes. This became the foundation of the PIE design system that powers JET's products globally.

I also mentored teams on component architecture and testing practices. Better code quality and faster onboarding for new engineers is hard to measure but easy to feel.
