## Building bridges between design and code

Joining Just Eat Takeaway during a pivotal time of digital transformation, I saw an opportunity to make a lasting impact on how the company built user interfaces. The challenge was clear: multiple product squads were building similar UI components in isolation, leading to inconsistency and wasted effort.

## Crafting a design system

I built a comprehensive design system in Vue that would eventually be adopted by approximately 10 product squads. This wasn't just about creating components—it was about establishing a shared language between designers and developers. I defined component API standards, created a versioning strategy, and developed migration playbooks that accelerated UI development velocity across the organization.

## Governance with autonomy

One of the most interesting challenges was establishing a governance model that enabled squad autonomy while maintaining consistency. I crafted contribution guidelines that gave teams the freedom to move fast while ensuring that customer-facing applications remained cohesive. It was about finding the right balance between centralization and decentralization.

## Testing as a first-class citizen

Understanding that a design system is only as good as its reliability, I integrated automated testing with Jest directly into our component library CI. This ensured API stability and reduced integration issues for teams consuming our components. When you have dozens of teams depending on your work, stability isn't optional—it's essential.

## Growing together

Mentoring frontend engineers on component architecture and testing practices became one of the most rewarding aspects of my role. Seeing teams improve their code quality and reduce onboarding time validated the investment in good documentation and knowledge sharing.
