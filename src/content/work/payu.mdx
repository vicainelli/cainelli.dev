PayU was where I learned something that shaped my career: in payments, every line of code directly impacts revenue. A faster checkout makes more money.

I spent most of my time optimizing checkout flows. We did rigorous A/B testing, trying button colors, form layouts, and entire user journeys. What started as guesswork became a systematic, data-driven approach. We increased conversions by 30% through performance improvements and UX changes.

Every millisecond mattered. Every form field got scrutinized. It was satisfying to watch conversion rates climb, but even more valuable was learning the discipline. I learned how to run good experiments, measure properly, and resist changing too many things at once.

I also led the institutional site rebrand. This was less about technical skills and more about coordination, bridging the gap between product and marketing to deliver a cohesive brand experience.

My three years at PayU were formative. Fintech teaches you to care about performance, security, and user experience because these have immediate, measurable consequences. That mindset of building at the intersection of technical excellence and business value is something I still carry with me.
