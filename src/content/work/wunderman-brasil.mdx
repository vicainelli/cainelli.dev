Wunderman was my first proper tech lead role. Suddenly I wasn't just responsible for my code. I was making technical decisions that would affect entire projects and teams. It was terrifying and exhilarating.

Working at an agency is unique. Every client has different needs, constraints, and visions. I defined technical architectures and migration strategies flexible enough to handle variety while remaining scalable and maintainable. It's like building foundations for buildings you haven't seen yet.

Migration projects were a big part of the work. They're never just about technology. They're about managing change while keeping systems running. I developed strategies for modernizing platforms incrementally, reducing risk while delivering continuous value.

I also coordinated between design and engineering teams. I established delivery standards to smooth collaboration and ensure quality. Watching designers and developers find common ground turned potential conflicts into partnerships.

Technical leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about asking the right questions, creating environments where teams can thrive, and balancing immediate needs with long-term vision. The best architecture is worthless without the team culture to sustain it.

This was also when Wunderman and J. Walter Thompson were merging to form Wunderman Thompson, so there was a lot of change. That environment teaches you to be adaptable and comfortable with ambiguity.
