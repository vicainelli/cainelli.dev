Mandaê was my first startup experience. This was 2016 in São Paulo. The company had about 2,000 customers, mostly small e-commerce businesses who needed help with shipping.

I built a shipment management platform in AngularJS. It sounds straightforward, but logistics is complicated, involving tracking packages across carriers, handling incidents, and giving accurate estimates. The platform became the operational backbone for customers, whether shipping one package or thousands per day.

I focused on component modularity early on. Without good patterns, we'd end up with a tangled mess. I created reusable, well-structured components that let the team ship features faster and keep things consistent.

The startup environment taught me how technical decisions translate directly to business impact. There's no buffer between writing code and affecting real customers. Code modularity isn't abstract. It's what lets a small team move fast without breaking things.

Mandaê was acquired by Nuvemshop in 2021. It was a formative time, and I still think about those lessons.
