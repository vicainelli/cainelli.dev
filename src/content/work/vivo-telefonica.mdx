When I joined Vivo, they had a customer self-service application that was showing its age. It worked but was becoming difficult to maintain. This is the face of the company for millions of customers.

I led the refactoring effort, moving to Vue and Jest. We focused on improving CSS architecture and component reusability. The goal was to create something sustainable for years to come.

The impact was tangible: support volume went down because customers could self-service effectively. Every improvement meant fewer frustrating phone calls and more people getting help without picking up the phone.

I also set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, transforming deployment from manual and stressful to smooth and predictable. We reduced manual QA cycles and accelerated release cadence. Teams could ship features faster with more confidence.

What I really liked was seeing the direct human impact. Great software isn't just elegant code. It's about improving people's lives. When a customer can quickly check data usage or pay a bill without friction, that's a win.
