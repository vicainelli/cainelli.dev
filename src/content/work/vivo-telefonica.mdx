## Transforming customer experience

At Vivo (Telefônica Brasil), I took on the challenge of refactoring a customer self-service application that was becoming difficult to maintain. The application was the face of the company for millions of customers, and it needed to reflect the quality and reliability that people expected from Brazil's leading telecommunications provider.

## Building with Vue and Jest

I led the refactoring effort using Vue and Jest, focusing on improving the CSS architecture and component reusability. This wasn't just about modernizing the codebase—it was about creating a more maintainable foundation that would serve customers for years to come. The result? A significant reduction in support volume as customers could now self-service more effectively.

## Automating quality

One of my key contributions was implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing. This transformed the deployment process from a manual, anxiety-inducing exercise into a smooth, predictable workflow. By reducing manual QA cycles, we not only decreased deployment risk but also accelerated our release cadence—allowing us to ship features faster and with more confidence.

## The human impact

What made this work particularly rewarding was seeing the direct impact on customers. Every improvement to the self-service application meant fewer frustrating phone calls to customer support and more people getting the help they needed, when they needed it. It was a reminder that great software isn't just about elegant code—it's about improving people's lives.
