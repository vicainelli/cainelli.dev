# {frontmatter.title}

I love building stuff.

Not the “launch a new SaaS and nurture the funnel” kind of building (though yeah, I’ve done my share of that too). I mean the other kind. Hands dirty... radio on... sawdust everywhere.
A project where the bugs are… splinters.

So I’m back in woodworking mode. My second no-code hobby. And I’m doing a very glamorous upgrade: the HVAC room. Shelves. Storage. The kind of thing nobody praises you for, but you feel weirdly proud every time you walk past it.

And then came "_The Moment_", you’re staring at a sheet of plywood and suddenly you’re doing finance math in your head.

Because that sheet isn’t cheap. And the cut plan in your notebook looks like a toddler’s Tetris game.

One wrong measurement and you’re not “iterating.” You’re just burning €€€.

## The problem (aka: why am I doing this by hand)

Here’s what I had:

- Standard plates: 2400mm x 1200mm
- A list of shelf pieces with different sizes (and quantities)
- A deadline that was basically “before motivation disappears”

What I needed was simple. Almost boring:

Give the tool the plate size. Give it the pieces. And then tell me how to cut it so I’m not wasting half the sheet like some kind of amateur.

But wow. The internet.

I went looking for a cutting optimizer and got three flavors:

1. Enterprise software with a pricing page that screams “talk to sales”
2. A mobile app with ads that feel like they were designed by a villain
3. Something that looks like Windows 95 survived and made a comeback… as a GUI

And look, I’m Dutch-adjacent enough at this point to get annoyed by inefficiency on principle. I’m not paying €200/month to cut shelves for a room that literally stores the vacuum cleaner.

## “Fine. I’ll build it.” (famous last words)

The dev brain kicks in fast, doesn’t it?

I could already picture it:

- Some `Piece` type
- A `Sheet`
- A packing algorithm
- A little renderer so I can _see_ the plan

And suddenly I’m halfway into a weekend project that has nothing to do with shelves. It’s just me, stuck in yet another “tiny tool” rabbit hole.

I’ve burned hours on this kind of thing before. Node.js hell. A dependency upgrade. A canvas lib that breaks because the moon phase changed. You know the vibe.

But this time I didn’t want the satisfaction of building it “properly.”

I just wanted the shelves.

## So I used AI. Like, actually used it.

Truth is, AI is best when you treat it like a ridiculously fast junior dev. Not a magical oracle. Not a vibes machine. A colleague you can give a ticket to, with clear acceptance criteria, and then you review the PR.

In my setup I used Claude Code with z.ai’s GLM-4.7 model.

And instead of asking it something vague like “how do I solve cutting stock,” I went super concrete:

- Here are the plate dimensions
- Here are the pieces (width/height/qty)
- I want the output to mirror the real world (no “perfect on screen, wrong in the workshop” surprises)
- I want a visual plan, not a 30-line explanation
- Optimize for layouts that are practical to cut (long straight cuts, guillotine style)

Because yes, an “optimal” layout that requires a hundred tiny weird cuts is not optimal. It’s punishment.

Also: real-world constraints matter. You don’t want to discover your “perfect” plan is off when you’re already holding a piece that’s somehow… not the size you expected. Ask me how I know. (Don’t. It hurts.)

## What came out the other side

In… honestly, minutes… I had a working tool.

Not production-ready. No auth. No database. No error states that would survive contact with the public internet.

And that’s the point.

It was disposable software. A micro-tool. A tiny app that lives just long enough to save your Saturday.

It took my list of pieces, did the layout math, and drew a plan I could actually follow in the workshop.

Waste areas highlighted. Pieces visible. The layout actually matched what I could do in the workshop.

And yeah, it felt a little ridiculous. Like cheating. Like printing the answer sheet.

But also: why wouldn’t I?

I’m not trying to win a coding competition here. I’m trying to avoid a second trip to the hardware store, standing there in my muddy shoes, re-buying wood because I got cocky with the measurements.

## The part that surprised me (and why I’m writing this)

But here’s what stuck with me:

I didn’t “learn” a new algorithm. I didn’t implement bin packing from scratch. I didn’t earn it the old-school way.

And yet… the result was better than what I would’ve shipped in a rushed afternoon.

Because the loop was tight:

Generate → run → stare at the layout → complain → regenerate.

“Too many weird cuts.”  
“Can you optimize for long straight cuts?”  
“Show me the waste more clearly.”  
“Account for blade width.”  
“Make the visual scale match reality.”

It’s the same kind of iteration you do in product engineering. Just without a sprint planning meeting and ten people arguing about naming.

And honestly? This is the sustainable tech angle nobody talks about: not “AI will save the planet” (please). But: less waste, fewer re-cuts, fewer extra trips, fewer materials tossed because you misplanned. Small efficiency wins. The Dutch way. Practical.

## If you’re reading this as an engineer

You already know what this is, right?

This is just building internal tooling… for your own life.

The same way you’ll hack a script to clean up a dataset, or write a quick dashboard to keep a system honest, you can do the same for physical-world problems.

And the threshold is lower now. Way lower.

Look, I’m not saying you should never write the algorithm yourself. If you _want_ to, go for it. Nerd out. Respect.

But if the goal is the shelf, not the solver…

Use the solver. Delete it later. Move on.

## So what’s your version of this?

What annoying, oddly-specific problem are you still doing manually?

A visa bureaucracy spreadsheet because you’re juggling an HSM thing and the forms are somehow always slightly wrong?  
A tiny accessibility checker because you’re tired of explaining contrast ratios to designers (again)?  
A one-off optimizer for your solar/battery schedule because you’re trying to keep your home energy setup a bit less dumb?

Tell me. Seriously. I’m curious what other “micro-tools” people are building now that we can just… spin them up after coffee and a quick garden walk.

And if you’ve got a better cutting optimizer idea, I’ll take it. I’ve still got more shelves to build.
