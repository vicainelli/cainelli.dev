If you've ever worked in tech, you've probably been in that situation: you're asked about a language, a framework, a tool, or system you've never touched — and instead of saying no, you say give me a minute.

That's what working in tech really is: the ability to learn in real time. To take everything, you've already learned — technical or not — and stack it together into something new that somehow works.

Because, let's be real: even when we look like we know what we're doing, we're still figuring things out as we go. Every new challenge is a remix of what we already know, built on top of layers and layers of past experiments, mistakes, and discoveries.

It's this weird blend of chaos and creativity. One moment you're deep into debugging a production issue, and the next you're reading the documentation for some tool that didn't exist last month. You constantly jump between understanding how something works and inventing a way to make it work for you.

Over time, you start to realize that your real “skill” isn't just coding or knowing the latest stack — it's the confidence that you'll be able to learn whatever comes next. It's that quiet trust in your process of discovery. And that is the gist of working with technology. We're always building new things, and still learning how to build them.
